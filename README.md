Requires CSP Disabler to be enabled (https only). It is highly recommended that you restrict the extension's reach to IXL only.

Goals:
Better prompt engineering + ability to change the prompt on the fly
Enable image-to-text functionality
Automate answer retrieval (to clipboard or answer space)
Fork CSP Disabler to be disguised and only function on IXL
